What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.?

-> I think if I get some more time I will introduce more features like a better Role Management, Dynamically add service types, a better analytics experience and booking experience.

What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language/framework? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

-> Technologies I used in this project are Node js with Typescript, express, MongoDB and React JS. In Typescript the most useful feature I found is strictly type checking wih helps me to prevent incompatible value exceptions .

How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

-> Got some issue while deploying on heroku for the first time. Took some help from Heroku doc and some other blogs.
